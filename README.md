Fetch Coding Exercise

Thank you for the opportunity for this coding exercise!

This was made using objective c, and should be able to be run just running the project file into XCode.

Unit tests were created for the viewmodel and loading files, but not the UITests.

The only visual issue I had was the favorite button being on a awkward part of the navigation bar, but I ran out of time with work this week to get to making my
own image and moving it.

I hope you enjoy what I've written!

Thank you,
Blake
